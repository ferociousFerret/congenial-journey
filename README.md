Incredibly bad site that uses browser camera permissions to scan an ISBN, then allow a user to add the found book to a 'shelf'.

This is the basis for a project that will eventually (ideally) allow a user to:
1. Build a 'shelf' of the physical books in their possession
2. Export that shelf as a CSV for later import into GoodReads (GoodReads doesn't allow public access to their API anymore)
